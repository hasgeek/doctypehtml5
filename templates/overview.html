<h3>What is HTML5?</h3>
<blockquote>
  HTML5, the new web standard that has been adopted by Apple, Google and many
  others, lets web developers create advanced graphics, typography, animations
  and transitions without relying on third party browser plug-ins (like Flash).
  HTML5 is completely open and controlled by a standards committee, of which
  Apple is a member.

<p>
  The term HTML5 has come to represent not just the new version of hypertext
  markup language, but a suite of related technologies and proposed standards.
  These include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>CSS3, Geo-location, Web Sockets, Canvas, Client Storage, Audio and Video.</li>
  <li>Rich Internet Apps enabled by Advanced JavaScript Engines and Mobile Browsers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>This event is for you</h3>
<p>
  The buzz and rapid evolution around HTML5 makes it hard to understand the
  technical, business and strategic implications of the latest version of the
  language that powers the world wide web. DocType HTML5 is aimed at senior
  web developers, mobile app developers, architects, and CTOs, and will
  provide a clear pathway to understanding everything about HTML5.
</p>
<p>
  With the rapid growth of Internet and Mobile, having a first-mover advantage
  is critical. Your company recognises the need to train its developers and
  align product strategy with upcoming technologies. This is why you must
  attend.
